Hello everyone :)
Here you have an instruction how to download and open my repository on your device.
1. If you are im my repository click a green button 'Code' on the right.
2. Choose option 'Download Zip'
3. Chose the location in your device, where you want to download my code.
4. When you download everything you should extract a file. (using for example a free program 'WinZip', here is a link where you can find it: https://www.winzip.com/en/pages/download/winzip-b3/?x-target=ppc&promo=ppc&gclid=Cj0KCQiA64GRBhCZARIsAHOLriITWSV_2o3ShmurvdbbbmLOxaNfV67dmT81IB5YrIrjTlioDF1vFBMaAk10EALw_wcB)
5. Now you need a program wchich is able to open and compile your file.
6. I recommend VS Code, it is free as well ;)
7. https://code.visualstudio.com/download
8. When you download Vs Code please install it.
9. After that you can open that file in VS Code. 
10. At the bottom you can find an option 'watch sass', click it please.
11. This compiles the file into css.
12. Now you can click on option called 'open with live server'.
13. Thanks to it you are able to check how the code looks in reality.
Enjoy:)
